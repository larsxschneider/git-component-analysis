# Git Component Analysis

This is a tool that aims to find components in a Git repository by analyzing the commit history. 

First, run the script `analyze-history.rb` to read all file pairs that have been changed together in the (recent) history (attention: this can run for a long time). Second, run the `find-components.rb` script to find components in the data captures from the first script.

Please read the header of the files for more information.
